# Bogo Bash
Hi there! This is my first project: a Linux-like bash shell called "Bogo Bash".

I developed this project solo in just 5 days. It is written entirely in the C language using standard libraries.


Key Features:

- 34 core commands for system interaction.

- 14 commands with flags for extended functionality.

- Custom "Bogo Bash" banner: A personalized splash screen showing system info, which can be called via the bogofetch command.

Good luck and enjoy!
